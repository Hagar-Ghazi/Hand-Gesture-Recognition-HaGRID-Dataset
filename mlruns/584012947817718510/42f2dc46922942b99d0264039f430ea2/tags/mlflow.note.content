XGBoost is a powerful implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance

 Unlike Random Forest (where trees are built independently) XGBoost builds trees sequentially  where each new tree attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones

It includes built-in penalties to prevent the model from becoming too complex which is helpful when landmarks are very similar

Using eval_metric="mlogloss" allows the model to optimize specifically for multi-class gesture classification
