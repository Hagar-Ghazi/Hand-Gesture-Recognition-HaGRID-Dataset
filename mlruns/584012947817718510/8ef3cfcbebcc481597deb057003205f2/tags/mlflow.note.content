Despite the "regression" in its name this is a linear model used for classification

It uses a logistic function to model the probability of a hand landmark set belonging to a specific gesture class

It is computationally lightweight and serves as an excellent baseline to see if your gesture classes are linearly separable

we have set max_iter=1000 to ensure the solver has enough time to converge on an optimal solution for your data
