Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Tuned The SVM is particularly effective for high-dimensional landmark data It works by finding an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin (distance) between different gesture classes

using the Radial Basis Function kernel which allows the model to handle non-linear relationships by mapping landmarks into a higher-dimensional space

Through  GridSearchCV  we balancing the penalty for misclassification  C with the "reach" of a single training example gamma to find the best fit for your specific gestures

By setting class_weight = 'balanced' we  ensure the model doesn't ignore gestures that might have fewer samples in your dataset
